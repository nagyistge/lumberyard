    /**
     * A motion event, which describes an event that happens at a given time in a motion.
     * This could be a footstep sound that needs to be played, or a particle system that needs to be spawened
     * or a script that needs to be executed. Motion events are completely generic, which means EMotion FX does not
     * handle the events for you. It is up to you how you handle the events. Also we do not specify any set of available events.
     * Each event can be identified with an event type string, which could for example be "SOUND" and a parameter string, for example "Footstep.wav".
     * It is up to you to parse these strings and perform the required actions.
     * All motion events are stored in a motion event table. This table contains the string data for the event types and parameters, which can be shared
     * between events. This will mean if you have 100 events that contain the strings "SOUND" and "Footstep.wav", those strings will only be stored in memory once.
     * To manually add motion events to a motion, do something like this:
     *
     * <pre>
     * motion->GetEventTable().AddEvent(0.0f, "SOUND",   "Footstep.wav");
     * motion->GetEventTable().AddEvent(3.0f, "SCRIPT",  "OpenDoor.script");
     * motion->GetEventTable().AddEvent(7.0f, "SOUND",   "Footstep.wav");
     * </pre>
     *
     * However, please keep in mind that you first need to register your event types (such as "SOUND") before you are allowed to add them to the event tables!
     * You can do this on the following way:<br>
     *
     * <pre>
     * EMFX_EVENTMGR.RegisterEvent("SOUND",  100);  // 100 is here some integer value that represents your unique event type ID that is passed to the ProcessEvent method of your event handler.
     * EMFX_EVENTMGR.RegisterEvent("SCRIPT", 101);  // 101 is another unique number, this can again be anything you like, as long as no other registered event types use it.
     * </pre>
     *
     * It is best to register your events to the event manager during initialization of your game.
     *
     * To create your own event handler, inherit a new class from MotionEventHandler and overload the ProcessEvent method.
     * Then use EMFX_EVENTMGR.SetMotionEventHandler( yourHandler ) to use your handler instead of GetEMotionFX()'s default one which only logs the events.
